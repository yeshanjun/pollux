## v0.3.1 — Legacy Farewell Release

This is the final legacy release before the project continues under its new name, **pollux**.

### What this release means

- The repository has been renamed from **gcli-nexus** to **pollux**.
- This is the **same repository** with preserved history and tags.
- **v0.3.1** marks the closing point of the legacy phase.
- Ongoing development continues here, starting from **v0.4.0** as a continuation + refactor.

### Included in v0.3.1

- Final legacy maintenance updates
- Stability/cleanup changes before transition
- Documentation updates for the rename and versioning plan

### Notes

No special migration is required for this release.
Future feature development targets the `v0.4.x` line.

Thanks to everyone who supported the legacy phase of the project.
