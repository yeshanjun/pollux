## v0.4.0 — Pollux Reboot

`v0.4.0` is the first official release under the new project identity: **pollux**.

This is not a brand-new project from scratch.  
It is a continuation and major refactor of the legacy `gcli-nexus` line, with a cleaner foundation for future development.

### Highlights

- Official project transition from **gcli-nexus** to **pollux**
- Core codebase refactor for the next development phase
- Updated repository identity, documentation, and release direction
- New baseline release line starting at **v0.4.x**

### Breaking Changes

- Project naming is now standardized as **pollux** across the repository and release line.
- Automation/scripts that reference legacy names (for example, old binary/artifact/repository identifiers) may require updates.
- Legacy line has been closed at **v0.3.1** and is no longer the main development track.

### Upgrade Notes

- Update any CI/CD scripts, deployment configs, or local tooling that still reference `gcli-nexus`.
- Use the renamed repository path and identifiers moving forward.
- Validate your build/release pipeline once after migration to ensure naming changes are fully applied.

### Legacy Reference

- **v0.3.1** remains the final legacy farewell snapshot before the Pollux phase.
